    // The Composition arrow <> is a solid diamond on a UML diagram.
    // The above means that a Polygon is composed of 3 or more Points.
    // UML also has a hollow diamond for Aggregation, but the textbook says
    // 'Aggregation is strictly meaningless; as a result, I recommend that
    // you ignore it in your own diagrams.' We will use Composition.

    // Technically, the above Composition says that a Circle is Composed
    // of one Point that has the role of its 'center'. Of course a
    // Circle would have other properties, at least a radius, but
    // that is elided (not shown) in this example.
