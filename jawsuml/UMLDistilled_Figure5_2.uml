        // The textbook discussion of Figure 5.2 says:
        // 'Static features are underlined on a class diagram.'
        // Since there is no way to underline plain text, our
        // notation uses the 'static' keyword, just like Java.
        // Static fields are shared by all objects in a class;
        // there is only one static field for all objects, not one
        // per object. Static methods can access static fields.
        // Also, I always use parentheses for methods, whereas
        // UML and the textbook denote methods by putting them in
        // a portion of the class box that is separated from the attributes
        // by a horizontal line.
